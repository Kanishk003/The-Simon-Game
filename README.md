# The-Simon-Game
The Simon game is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The HTML consists of a container with four colored buttons representing the game's lights and a start button to begin the game. The CSS styles these buttons to resemble the classic Simon game, using distinct colors and positioning to create a circular layout. JavaScript is used to handle the game logic, including generating random sequences of lights, playing corresponding sounds, and checking the player's input against the generated sequence to determine if the game continues or ends. This combination of technologies creates an interactive and visually appealing memory game.
